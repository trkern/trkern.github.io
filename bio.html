<h3> Independent Educational Video Development (2022-present)</h3>
<ul>
<li> I am currently focusing on developing lecture videos for Youtube. This process involves literature research, independent mathematical research, learning video editing techniques, and creating visualizations. Highlights include:
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://youtu.be/ZS8PfP_JCdA">Introducing Model Theory with Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé Games on Linear Orderings</a>: Submission to the Summer of Math Exposition #2
<li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apKPhtM6od0&list=PL8nlk4F6cN8Ycoxurjdpf8_TvOWVjIffo">Regular Languages and Model Theory</a>: A long lecture series with the goal of guiding a mathematically mature audience through the necessary automata and model theory to make sense of my PhD thesis.
<li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY01II_p7h4">Goals-Based Teaching and Assessment</a>: A summary of my teaching philosophy based on my reading of "Grading for Equity" and "Understanding by Design".
<li> <a href="https://youtu.be/HayXSGMF1f8">A Teaching Book Report: "Why Don't Students Like School?"</a>: A summary of what I learned reading through a book by Daniel Willingham about the cognitive science of learning.
<li> <a href="https://trkern.itch.io/fractran">FRACTRAN</a>: A coding puzzle game meant to guide a user through learning to code in FRACTRAN, an esoteric programming language by John Conway.
