{id:'UCWiXJjSEpI', title:"Richardson's Theorem", timestamp:1746332575, upload_date:'20250504', duration:2743, description:'In this video, I review the proof of Richardson\'s Theorem: there is no algorithm that, given two algebraic expressions with sines and absolute values, can always tell us if they\'re equivalent. NOTE: This video builds off the negative result to Hilbert\'s Tenth Problem, as covered in my "Practical Programming of Diophantine Equations" video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE4AFD3-eko\n\nThe removal of pi from Richardson\'s theorem comes from "The Removal of \u03c0 from some Undecidable Problems Involving Elementary Functions" by M. Laczkovich (2002): https://doi.org/10.1090%2FS0002-9939-02-06753-9 , which actually does quite a bit more, reducing the arbitrary nesting of sine functions to just sines of sines.\n\nFor some simple open (or recently solved) Diophantine equations, see this mathoverflow question: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/316708/what-is-the-smallest-unsolved-diophantine-equation\nThe result that there is a universal Diophantine equation in 9 variables is from Jones\' "Universal Diophantine Equation" (1982). You can find that universal equation in Matiyasevich\'s book or at https://mathoverflow.net/a/81986 . Jones also discusses tradeoffs between number of variables and degree, which I discuss here: https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4177711\n\nYou can find a plot of F for the Pell equation example on Desmos here: https://www.desmos.com/3d/4udygvrvmt but it isn\'t particularly useful since the graph isn\'t necessarily sampled at integer points, so the precise depth of the peaks is hard to make out. The graph in the video is from my own graphing calculator here: https://trkern.github.io/richardson_pell\n\nI asked about the possibility of Richardson space-filling curves here: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/5058651/is-there-a-subelementary-surjection-mathbbr-to-mathbbr2\n\nThe two-dimensional plot for the Pell equation example is from Desmos: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/bc00f3bs8t . Note that this doesn\'t show the whole parameterized curve starting from t=0, that\'s really too much to expect of any graphing calculator. \n\nNote that some sources claim that Richardson\'s Theorem extends into the zero-variable case: that determining if two variable-free Richardson expressions (expressions representing constant numbers) is also undecidable. This wouldn\'t be surprising: one can imagine an algorithm calculating both sides to greater and greater precision and one never being sure if the two sides are equivalent or we just haven\'t gotten to a precision level where they differ. However, I haven\'t been able to find a cited paper or proof that this case actually is undecidable.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n04:48 The Plan\n09:27 The Tricky Bit with Absolute Values\n14:39 Dominating Polynomials\n17:47 History Sidenote\n18:43 Multivariable MVT\n20:43 Constructing F\n24:31 Example: Pell Equation\n27:19 The One Variable Case\n42:10 Summary\n\nSources:\nThe original Richardson paper is "Some Undecidable Problems Involving Elementary Functions of a Real Variable" (1968), but I also referenced the proof in Caviness\' 1970 paper "On Canonical Forms and Simplification": https://doi.org/10.1145%2F321574.321591 , which is mostly identical.\n\nThe history of Hilbert\'s Tenth problem is from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_tenth_problem) and Matiyasevich\'s "Hilbert\'s Tenth Problem" (1993).\n\nThe proof of the multivariable mean value theorem is from Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_value_theorem'},

Primitive recursive arithmetic is a formal system that allows us to prove pretty much any facts we\'d like about primitive recursive functions with a very simple set of rules.\n\nNote that my assertion about induction around 32 minutes in is a bit misleading: you can use induction to prove new equations in primitive recursive arithmetic. However, since the larger system that proves the consistency of primitive recursive arithmetic can express more, the larger system has more formulas that can be inducted over. See "On the Consistency and Undecidability of Recursive Arithmetic" (Rose, 1961) for more details.\n\nSources:\nSkolem\'s "The foundations of elementary arithmetic established by means of the recursive mode of thought, without the use of apparent variables ranging over infinite domains" (1923) translated and with introduction in van Heijenoort\'s "From Frege to G\xf6del" (1967).\nGoodstein\'s "Recursive Number Theory, A development of Recursive Arithmetic in a Logic-Free Equation Calculus" (1957)\n\nThe Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\'s article on Hilbert\'s program helped put PRA in philosophical context:\nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hilbert-program/\n\nYou can read more about the conservativity of WKL_0 over PRA here: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reverse-mathematics/#WeakKnigLemm\nAnd read more about what WKL_0 is on Wikipedia:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_mathematics\n\nAnd read more about Friedman\'s Grand Conjecture here:\nhttps://mathoverflow.net/questions/39452/status-of-harvey-friedmans-grand-conjecture\n\nHilbert\'s "On the Infinite" does not explicitly talk about primitive recursive arithmetic, but puts into context the philosophical thinking that was going on at the time.'},

Since the function that updates the state of a Turing machine is primitive recursive, we just need tools for applying this update function until it reaches a halt state: either arbitrary while or for loops, the ability to define f(n) recursively in terms of f(m) for potentially larger m, or Kleene's mu-operator.\n\nI found all this information on Wikipedia.

Robinson\'s "Primitive Recursive Functions" (1947). While the first part of this article is mostly very clear to read, note that the use of the function 0^x is genuinely exponentiation, in the combinatoricist\'s sense, where 0^0 = 1 and 0^x = 0 for x greater than 0.

This study of mapping out the boundary between decidable and undecidable structures -- what structure we can add in what combinations to remain decidable or wind up undecidable -- is an interesting and well-studied field. Many of these results are interdependent, and some exhibit common themes of working with recursion.\n\nThe question of extensions of Presburger Arithmetic by a unary predicate is addressed in A.L. Semenov\'s "On Certain Extensions of the Arithmetic of Addition of Natural Numbers". Mathematics of The Ussr-izvestiya, 15, 401-418.\n\nThe concatenation result is from "Concatenation as a Basis for Arithmetic" by W. V. Quine. Journal of Symbolic Logic 11 (4):105-114 (1946).

In this video I sketch the proofs, talk about applications to Presburger arithmetic, and explore a little bit of the theory of expressiveness.\n\nB\xfcchi originally described the Weak Monadic Second Order Theory of 1 Successor (and the precursor to B\xfcchi arithmetic) in "Weak Second-Order Arithmetic and Finite Automata". The precursor to B\xfcchi arithmetic was incorrect, using an "is a power of 2" predicate.\n\nR. MacNaughton pointed out this mistake in his 1963 review of B\xfcchi\'s paper (Journal of Symbolic Logic 28.01) and proposed an easy fix of replacing "is a power of 2" by "x is a 1 in the binary representation of y".\n\nThe history of V_2, according to  "Logic and p-Recognizable Sets of Integers" (Bruy\xe8re, V., Hansel, G., Michaux, C., Villemaire, R., 1994):\n\nSomeone named M.

Paris 303 (1986)."\n\nUnfortunately, I don\'t know French and haven\'t been able to find these papers.\n\nFor a proof of why replacing V_2 with Pw_2 in the first-order theory of natural numbers with addition strictly reduces the expressive strength, see "On Certain Extensions of the Arithmetic of Addition of Natural Numbers" by A.
