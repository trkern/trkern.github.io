<p>To supplement my classes, I have been putting together a series of educational interactives in javascript. You are welcome to use them for educational purposes. I've put <span style='color:green'>*</span>s next to my favorites if you're not sure where to get started.</p>

<p>Interactives have been tested in Google Chrome and most have been tested in Firefox, and they may not work or appear correctly in other browsers, particularly Internet Explorer, or on devices with small screens such as phones.</p>

<p>I also make <a href='youtube/index.html'>educational videos</a> about logic, teaching, and general mathematics.</p>
